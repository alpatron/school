# Asteroids
A simple game of Asteroids coded as a school assignment in Java. ~~Probably~~ Definitely not the most elegant code, but I like it. It features vector graphics, woah!  
The collision detection can be wonky and asteroids can get stuck; I am too lazy to fix that.  
Nota bene, this is my personal account to which I transferred the source code, no plagiarism took place.
